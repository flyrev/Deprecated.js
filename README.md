The deprecated JavaScript Framework!

## Install globally :D
`npm install -g deprecated.js` - because, after all, WHY would you not install a LIBRARY ... GLOBALLY?! :D

Please do this on every computer you can! Rent more instances in AWS just to do this, if you can.

## Install as a normal dependency
`npm install deprecated.js`

This will give the following output:
```
npm WARN deprecated deprecated.js@1.0.1: Every version of this is deprecated
/usr/lib
└── deprecated.js@1.0.1 
```

Please do this in as many projects as you possibly can!

## Run tests
`npm test`

# `yarn`, `pnpm`, etc.
Coming soon!

## GitHub Actions used
* Rebase by typing `/rebase` in a PR comment! https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automatic-rebase#installation
* We lint the `Dockerfile`! https://github.com/brpaz/hadolint-action

## Usage
BE WARNED! This framework is deprecated. Please refrain from using it, despite its excellence.

... and do not think that any "replacement library" is planned.
